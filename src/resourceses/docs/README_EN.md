We are developing a plugin called "ElysiumLogin," just as its name suggests, it is a plugin for player login. However, what sets it apart is that it is a customized plugin with more features designed for the web interface.

In terms of functionality, it has the essential login features that a typical login plugin would have. But it has removed the registration and password reset features, instead implementing these functions on the web interface.

Additionally, it also has a decentralized-like feature for group servers. This means that if data changes in one server, the other servers will automatically update their local data accordingly.
